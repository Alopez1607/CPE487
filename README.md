# Coin Collecting Maze
---
  The project is a VGA-based interactive game that uses an FPGA to render a Pac-Man-inspired maze where a pac-man shape ball collects coins and navigates to the maze exit. The game starts with the ball positioned at an initial location, and coins are distributed throughout the maze. The player uses the buttons on the board (btnU, btnD, btnL, btnR) to control the ball's movement as well as btnc to reset the game, while collision detection prevents it from passing through walls. As the ball overlaps with coins, they disappear, and the game tracks the total coins collected while displaying the coin count on the board display. Once all coins are collected, the player must guide the ball to the exit of the maze to reset the game.
